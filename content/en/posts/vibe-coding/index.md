## Development Environment Setup (macOS)

Follow these steps to set up your vibe coding environment on macOS:

### 1. Create a GitHub Account

Visit [GitHub Signup](https://github.com/signup) and follow the prompts to create an account. GitHub is essential for:

- Collaborating with developers
- Version controlling your code
- Contributing to open-source projects

### 2. Install Cursor IDE

Visit [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), download the installer for your OS, and follow these steps after installation:

- Open Cursor
- Sign in with your GitHub account
- Enable AI features when prompted

### 3. Install Homebrew

Follow the [official Homebrew installation guide](https://brew.sh).

### 4. Install Node.js

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install node
```

### 5. Install Git

Install via Homebrew:

```bash
brew install git
```

### 6. Create a Next.js Project

Generate your project using the latest Next.js template:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-project
cd my-project
```

### 7. Start Development Server

Start your development server to view your project:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see your project running locally.

## Building Blocks of the Internet

Just like LEGO blocks, the web is built using different technologies:

- **HTML** — The structure, like the bricks you use to build castles.
- **CSS** — Styles your structure, making the bricks colorful and visually appealing.
- **JavaScript** — Brings interactivity and life, just like motors and sensors in a LEGO robot.

## Version Control and Security

- **Version Control**: Git and GitHub help you keep track of your changes and collaborate seamlessly.
- **Security**: Keep your credentials and sensitive data secure—if something feels off, it probably is!
